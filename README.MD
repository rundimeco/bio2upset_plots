For a command line usage : python bio_to_upset_plots.py DIR

-  where DIR is the directory where the aligned result files (BIO format) are stored

For an external usage
- call the files_2_cat function with a path containg BIO files

  
The names displayed on the graphs will be derived from the filenames

TODO:
- better handling of BIO format
- offer the possibility to select the appropriate columns
- display messages  regarding the quality of the data
